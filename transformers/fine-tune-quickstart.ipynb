I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

Ok first of all, 20 dollars per car to get in maybe it's worth it to you maybe not but it's gonna cost you 20 dollars to find out. There are aspects of the light display that are really nice. The lighting on the tunnel going into the speedway was very well done and the coordinated music/light display in the stands as you drive around the track was also well done. The rest of the display was a bunch of those wire framed Christmas light things (some of them animated)  scattered about the infield that you drove past. Pretty ok but once you've seen a few you pretty much get it. There are a bunch of signs letting you know that the light display is being sponsored (the two I remember were Bojangles and Bank of America) so they're getting corporate money ~and~ charging 20 dollars a car. The Christmas village was free to get into but it cost money to do stuff once you got it. My niece really REALLY wanted to ride a camel so sis and I took her in. A camel ride was 5 dollars for one (1) time around. . . took about 20 seconds. . . .  Sis and I are going to by a camel and hit the road we figure we can give kids two times around (twice the value . . but wait there's MORE)  for the same price and make a BUNCH of money. Seriously though, there was no one waiting there was no line, the was no crowd of kids screaming to ride the camel apparently the going rate for camel riding is 5 dollars for 20 seconds (that's 900 dollars a hour . . I'm telling you guys this camel business is the place to be). Anyway niece was happy so I guess it was good. The consensus among the family was it was ok to do once but we won't be back.</td>\n",
